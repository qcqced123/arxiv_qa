[57], line transformer-based approach finds candidate poses attaining the most line matches with the query image, and refines poses using pnp-ransac. for establishing line matches, we first render nt × nr synthetic views from the point cloud where we set nt = 100 and nr = 216. then, the top k1 = 100 poses are selected whose netvlad [3] features are closest to the query image. this intermediate step is necessary as the line transformer features are com- putationally expensive and thus could not be naively evalu- ated for all nt × nr views. for each synthetic view from the selected poses, we extract line transformer embeddings and establish matchings with the query image. similar to the structure-based baseline, we convert panoramas to cube- maps during the line matching process. finally, we select the top k2 = 20 poses that have the most line matches, and refine them via pnp-ransac.\n",

[34] and use the perceptual loss and mean absolute error (mae) loss, where we employ adam [28] with a learning rate of 1e−4 for op- timization. in our experiments, we use the trained network to reconstruct panoramas from the local feature descriptors, where we shared the reconstruction results along with the image error metrics in section 4 and section b. to elab- orate, during evaluation we first extract local features for each query image in the stanford 2d-3d-s dataset [4] and run feature inversion, where the results are then compared against the original\n",

      "Modern language models capture a large body of factual knowledge. However, some facts can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time, resulting in factually in- correct generations. This has led to the de- velopment of various editing methods that allow updating facts encoded by the model. Evaluation of these methods has primarily focused on testing whether an individual fact has been successfully injected, and if sim- ilar predictions for other subjects have not changed. Here we argue that such evaluation is limited, since injecting one fact (e.g. “Jack Depp is the son of Johnny Depp”) introduces a “ripple effect” in the form of additional facts that the model needs to update (e.g., “Jack Depp is the sibling of Lily-Rose Depp”). To address this, we propose novel evaluation criteria that consider the implications of an edit on related facts. Using these criteria, we then construct RIPPLEEDITS, a diagnos- tic benchmark of 5K factual edits, capturing various types of ripple effects. We evaluate\n",

      "This limitation has prompted research on knowl- edge editing (KE) methods, which modify LMs to fix their factual errors (we provide a formal defini- tion in §2). Knowledge editing work has focused on applying factual updates to LMs. Given an entity-relation-object triplet (e, r, o) representing a fact (e.g. “Lionel Messi plays for the Inter Mi- ami team”), recent work proposed various methods (Mitchell et al., 2022a; Meng et al., 2022, 2023; Hernandez et al., 2023b; Si et al., 2023) to inject\n",

      "[context7]\n",
      "this fact into the parameters of a given LM, while “overriding” beliefs the model might have on e and r (e.g. that Messi plays for Paris Saint-Germain). A key question with KE is how to evaluate the success of such editing operations. The most basic “sanity-check” is that the model correctly completes (e, r, ?), as well as other paraphrases of this task, with o. However, this is not enough as an evalua- tion, since one needs to check that the model did not distort other facts. Indeed, the standard evalua- tion protocol (Mitchell et al., 2022b; Meng et al., 2022, 2023) for KE focuses on these two aspects of correctly completing various paraphrases of the new fact, as well as ensuring that other unrelated facts have not been changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[context8]\n",
      "In this work, we argue that to evaluate model edits, one should go beyond the single fact that was edited and check that other facts that are logically derived from the edit were also changed accord- ingly. For example, if z is the mother of e, then the children of z are the siblings of e. Consequently, once we modify the belief of a certain model that z → z′ is the mother of e, then we should also en- sure that the model’s belief regarding the siblings of e is also correct. Fig. 1 illustrates another ex- ample, where editing the Team for which Lionel Messi plays modifies other related facts, such as his country of residence, while other facts should be retained. We refer to such changes that are im- plied by a factual edit as “ripple effects”.\n",
      "\n",
      "[context9]\n",
      "To account for ripple effects in the evaluation of factual edits, we propose six concrete evaluation criteria (see §3, Fig. 2), for testing which facts other than the edit itself should be modified or retained post-editing. Our tests evaluate how well the model integrates the edit with the rest of its knowledge, through queries that involve logical reasoning, complex composition of facts with the edit as an intermediate step, subject aliasing, and specificity across relations.\n",
      "Building upon these criteria, we create RIP- PLEEDITS, a new benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of KE of LMs (see §4). RIPPLEEDITS includes 5K entries, each consisting of a factual edit, along with a set of test queries that check if the edit was successful in terms of its ripple effect. Moreover, RIPPLEEDITS contains meta-data for each edit, including information about the times- tamp of the edit (i.e., recent versus old), and the popularity of the entities (i.e., head versus tail).\n",
